# Survey of METAR/TAF/Other Observation Data Sources

## Introduction

The WeatherVane project's primary objective is to track trends and
accuracy not only in aviation forecasts, but also in climate and extreme
weather frequency over various regions and temporal intervals.
Therefore, it is critical that a sizeable archive of reference data
spanning years (if not decades) and with a high resolution (i.e.
incorporating independent measurements from as many weather stations
and/or aerodromes as possible) is available for comparison against
current observations (e.g. METAR), forecasts (e.g. TAF), and any other
secondary meteorological data that may be useful in providing meaningful
and actionable results.

The following sections will describe various online resources and
compare the advantages and limitations of each over temporal, spatial,
national, and monetary bounds.
